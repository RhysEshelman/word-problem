I was given the problem of reading in a large text file and extracting words and sentences from said file. I also had to determine the readability level of the text by looking at things like sentence length and average syllable counts. This is basically a word processing problem where I had to remove delimiters, unwanted puntuations, and other anomalies in the text file. Then I used some formulas to determine the difficulty rating of the text.

To use the program, call the functions in the python file using input.txt or any txt file as the input. Comments in the code should give enough information to know the required inputs of each function.
