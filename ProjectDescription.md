I was given the problem of reading in a large text file and extracting words and sentences from said file.
I also had to determine the readability level of the text by looking at things like sentence length and average syllable counts.
This is basically a word processing problem where I had to remove delimiters, unwanted puntuations, and other anomalies in the text file.
Then I used some formulas to determine the difficulty rating of the text.
